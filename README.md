### 🔥 NJOYA MEDIN — Full-Stack Lead & Database Architect
**Skill Level: Full-Stack (Strong)**
**Role: Technical Lead — owns the hardest, most critical parts of the project**

NJOYA carries the database foundation and the most complex backend logic. As team lead, he also reviews and integrates everyone else's work.

- [x] Implement JWT authentication (register, login, refresh, logout)
- [x] Build `Users`, `Roles`, `Customers`, `Sellers` models, serializers, and views
- [x] Implement role-based permission classes (`IsAdmin`, `IsSeller`, `IsCustomer`)
- [x] Build `Orders` API — calls `place_order()` stored procedure
- [x] Build `Payments` handler (webhook simulation endpoint in Orders API)
- [x] Build Admin analytics API (revenue by currency, top products, user growth)
- [x] Set up Celery + scheduled task for hourly exchange rate refresh (OpenExchangeRates API)

#### Frontend (Next.js)

### 🌱 CHE BRIGHT — Frontend Developer (Guided)
**Skill Level: Basic HTML/CSS + Git + Basic SQL**
**Role: Frontend pages + Git repository manager**

Che handles frontend pages that follow an existing design pattern (set by NJOYA). His Git knowledge makes him the team's repository manager. SQL tasks are limited to writing simple queries with guidance.

#### Git & Project Management
- [ ] Create and maintain the GitHub repository
- [ ] Set up branch structure: `main`, `dev`, `feature/member-name`
- [ ] Write and enforce the pull request rules (no direct push to main)
- [ ] Manage merges and resolve basic conflicts
- [ ] Keep the README updated with progress

#### Frontend (Next.js — follows patterns set by NJOYA)
- [ ] Product listing page (`app/products/page.tsx`) — grid layout with filter sidebar
- [ ] Product detail page (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`) — image gallery, variant selector, add to cart
- [ ] Search results page (`app/search/page.tsx`) — faceted filters
- [ ] Cart page (`app/cart/page.tsx`) — items list, quantity update, remove, totals
- [ ] Wishlist page (`app/wishlist/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Build reusable components: `ProductCard`, `FilterSidebar`, `PriceTag`, `TierBadge`

#### Database (guided, simple tasks)
- [ ] Write the seed SQL for: 20 sample products with variants and attributes
- [ ] Write the seed SQL for: 10 sample customers across different tiers
- [ ] Document what each table does in a `DATABASE_NOTES.md` file (1 paragraph per table)

> 💡 **Mentor note for Che:** NJOYA will provide component templates and design tokens. Your job is to implement pages by following the existing patterns. When stuck on SQL, refer to `database/seeds/001_seed_data.sql` as a reference. Ask before writing complex queries.

### 🌱 ABOSI BLESSING — Documentation, Testing & Basic SQL
**Skill Level: Basic SQL + Total beginner in code**
**Role: Project documentation lead + SQL data entry + manual testing**

Blessing does not write application code but plays a critical role in keeping the project documented, tested, and presentable. Her basic SQL knowledge is used for data tasks.

#### Documentation (primary responsibility)
- [ ] Write the full `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` — how to use the app as a customer, seller, and admin (with screenshots once pages are built)
- [ ] Write `docs/API_GUIDE.md` — describe every API endpoint in plain English (NJOYA provides the list)
- [ ] Write `docs/DATABASE_DESIGN.md` — explain the ERD in plain English (what each entity is, why it exists)
- [ ] Write `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` — step-by-step instructions for running the project locally
- [ ] Maintain the project's `CHANGELOG.md` — log every feature completed each week
- [ ] Prepare the final presentation slides (PowerPoint / Google Slides) for demo day

#### SQL Data Tasks (guided)
- [ ] Write seed SQL for: currencies (all 12 supported), warehouses (all 5 locations)
- [ ] Write seed SQL for: customer tiers (Standard, Premium, VIP with correct values)
- [ ] Write seed SQL for: 5 coupon codes with different discount types
- [ ] Use pgAdmin (GUI tool) to verify seed data was inserted correctly — take screenshots for docs

#### Testing (manual)
- [ ] Create a `docs/TEST_CASES.md` file — write 30 manual test cases (feature, steps, expected result, pass/fail)
- [ ] Test every page once it is built by CHE or NJOYA — report bugs in GitHub Issues
- [ ] Test checkout flow end-to-end with different currencies
- [ ] Test tier upgrade by manually updating `lifetime_value` in pgAdmin and checking if trigger fires

> 💡 **Mentor note for Blessing:** You don't need to write JavaScript or Python. Focus on being the team's quality and knowledge manager. Use pgAdmin (a visual tool) for all SQL tasks — you don't need to use the terminal. NJOYA will give you the SQL templates to fill in. Your documentation is what makes the project look professional.

### 🌱 OBEMO EMMANUEL — Backend Junior & Seller Dashboard
**Skill Level: Basic HTML/CSS + Basic Python**
**Role: Supporting backend developer + Seller-facing frontend**

Emmanuel knows Python and basic HTML/CSS which makes him suitable for simple Django views and the Seller dashboard frontend. He will work on backend tasks that don't require deep SQL knowledge, and frontend pages that follow set patterns.

#### Backend (Django — simple views with guidance)
- [ ] Build `Products` CRUD API (`apps/products/`) — list, create, update, delete (NJOYA sets up models)
- [ ] Build `Categories` API — hierarchical listing
- [ ] Build `Reviews` API — submit review, list reviews for a product
- [ ] Build `Cart` API — add item, remove item, update quantity, clear cart
- [ ] Build `Wishlist` API — add, remove, list
- [ ] Build `Shipments` tracking API — update status, get tracking info
- [ ] Build `Notifications` API — list notifications, mark as read
- [ ] Build `Warehouses` & basic `Inventory` listing API (read-only)

#### Frontend (Next.js — Seller Dashboard)
- [ ] Seller Dashboard layout (`app/seller/layout.tsx`) — sidebar, header
- [ ] Seller Dashboard home (`app/seller/page.tsx`) — stats overview (total sales, orders, top products)
- [ ] Seller product management (`app/seller/products/`) — list, add new product, edit, toggle publish
- [ ] Seller orders view (`app/seller/orders/`) — view orders containing their products
- [ ] Customer Dashboard layout and home (`app/customer/`) — order history, tier status, loyalty points
- [ ] Order tracking page (`app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`) — status timeline, shipment info

> 💡 **Mentor note for Emmanuel:** For the backend, NJOYA will set up all the Django models and database connections. Your job is to write the API views (functions that receive requests and return responses). Study the pattern of one completed view (NJOYA will show you one), then repeat that pattern for your assigned endpoints. For frontend, follow the component templates CHE is using. When Python is confusing, read the Django REST Framework quickstart guide first.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16
- Redis (for Celery)
- pgAdmin 4 (GUI for database — recommended for Blessing)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-team/digitalfashion-hub.git
cd digitalfashion-hub
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
createdb digitalfashion_hub
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/schema/001_create_tables.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/schema/002_indexes.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/triggers/001_inventory_reorder.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/triggers/002_tier_upgrade.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/triggers/003_audit_log.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/seeds/001_currencies_warehouses_tiers_seed.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/seeds/002_products_seed.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/seeds/003_customers_seed.sql
psql digitalfashion_hub < database/seeds/004_coupons_seed.sql
```

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env           # Fill in your credentials
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

App: `http://localhost:3000` | API: `http://localhost:8000/api/`

For Vercel deployments, set `BACKEND_API_URL` in the project environment variables to the public Django API URL. The frontend now proxies `/api/v1/*` through its own origin, so the browser never calls `localhost` directly in production.
